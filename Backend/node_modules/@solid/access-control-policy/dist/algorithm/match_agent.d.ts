 * # The agent matching algorithm
 *
 * The context agent should be an IRI identifying the agent by virtue of the agent having proven he controls the IRI. For example, this IRI could be a WebID as defined by the WebID specification and over which control has been asserted as defined in the Solid OIDC specification.
 *
 * The context matches if the matcher agent attribute contains:
 * - The defined context agent; or
 * - The ACP Public Agent; or
 * - The ACP Authenticated Agent and the given context agent is defined; or
 * - The ACP Creator Agent and the context creators include the agent; or
 * - The ACP Owner Agent and the context owners include the agent.
 *
 * @param matcher The matcher to evaluate
 * @param context The context in which the matcher is evaluated
 * @returns True if there is a match, false otherwise
