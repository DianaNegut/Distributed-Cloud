 * Generates the necessary `content-range` header if there is range metadata.
 * If the start or end is unknown, a `*` will be used instead.
 * According to the RFC, this is incorrect,
 * but is all we can do as long as we don't know the full length of the representation in advance.
 * For the same reason, the total length of the representation will always be `*`.
 *
 * This class also adds the content-length header.
 * This will contain either the full size for standard requests,
 * or the size of the slice for range requests.
