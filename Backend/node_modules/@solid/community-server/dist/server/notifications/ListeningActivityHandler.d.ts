 * Listens to an {@link ActivityEmitter} and calls the stored {@link NotificationHandler}s in case of an event
 * for every matching notification channel found.
 *
 * Takes the `rate` feature into account so only channels that want a new notification will receive one.
 *
 * Extends {@link StaticHandler} so it can be more easily injected into a Components.js configuration.
 * No class takes this one as input, so to make sure Components.js instantiates it,
 * it needs to be added somewhere where its presence has no impact, such as the list of initializers.
