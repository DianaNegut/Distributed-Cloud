 * Encodes the input key with SHA-256 hashing,

 * This class was created specifically to prevent the issue of identifiers being too long when storing data:
 * https://github.com/CommunitySolidServer/CommunitySolidServer/issues/1013
 *
 * This should eventually be replaced by a more structural approach once internal storage has been refactored
 * and data migration from older versions and formats is supported.
