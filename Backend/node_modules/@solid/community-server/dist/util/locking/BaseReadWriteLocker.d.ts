/**
 * A {@link ReadWriteLocker} that allows for multiple simultaneous read operations.
 * Write operations will be blocked as long as read operations are not finished.
 * New read operations are allowed while this is going on, which will cause write operations to wait longer.
 *
 * Based on https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Readers%E2%80%93writer_lock#Using_two_mutexes .
 * As soon as 1 read lock request is made, the main lock is locked.
 * Internally a counter keeps track of the amount of active read locks.
 * Only when this number reaches 0 will the main lock be released again.
 * The internal count lock is only locked to increase/decrease this counter and is released afterwards.
 * This allows for multiple read operations, although only 1 at the time can update the counter,
 * which means there can still be a small waiting period if there are multiple simultaneous read operations.
 *
 * Classes extending this need to implement `getCountLockIdentifier` and `modifyCount`.
